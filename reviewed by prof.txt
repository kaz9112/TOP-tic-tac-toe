Here are some suggestions to improve your code and reduce global scope:

1. Wrap the entire game logic in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to create a module for the game. This will help contain all game-related variables and functions within a single scope.

2. Move the `createGameGrid` function inside the game module and call it during initialization.

3. Create a `displayController` module to handle all DOM-related operations. Move the game grid creation and cell event listeners into this module.

4. Refactor the `newPlayer` factory to be a regular function, as you're creating multiple instances of players.

5. Create a `gameController` module to manage the game state, including turn management, win conditions, and game flow.

6. Move the `winConditions` function inside the `gameController` module.

7. Instead of using global variables for `playerX` and `playerO`, create them inside the game module and pass them to the necessary functions.

8. Remove the `playerTurn` function as it's not being used in the current implementation.

9. Use the module pattern for `gameBoard` to encapsulate its data and provide methods to interact with it.

10. Implement a `render` function in the `displayController` to update the game board display based on the game state.

11. Create an `init` function in the game module to set up the initial game state and start the game.

12. Use event delegation for cell clicks instead of adding event listeners to each cell individually.

13. Implement a way to reset the game and update the score.

By following these suggestions, you'll create a more modular and encapsulated structure for your Tic Tac Toe game, reducing the amount of code in the global scope and improving overall organization.

Here are some suggestions for improving your code by minimizing global code and using the module pattern:

1.  Move `createGameGrid` inside `createGameBoard` to encapsulate the game grid creation logic within the game board module.
2.  Move `gameCells` variable inside `gamePlay` factory to reduce global code.
3.  Convert `playerTurn` to a function that returns an object with a method, similar to `newPlayer`, to encapsulate the player turn logic.
4.  Move `winConditions` inside `playerTurn` factory to encapsulate the winning conditions logic within the player turn module.
5.  Create a new factory `gameController` that encapsulates the game logic, including creating the game board, players, and running the game.
6.  Move the game initialization code inside the `gameController` factory to reduce global code.
7.  Use a single instance of `gameController` to run the game, instead of creating multiple instances of `gamePlay`.
8.  Consider using a more robust way to handle player turns, such as using a state machine or a finite state automaton.
9.  Consider adding input validation for player moves to prevent invalid moves.
10. Consider adding a way to reset the game or start a new game.
11. Consider using a more modular approach to organizing your code, such as using separate files for each module.
12. Consider using a linter or code formatter to improve code readability and consistency.

By following these suggestions, you can improve the organization and maintainability of your code, and reduce the amount of global code.
